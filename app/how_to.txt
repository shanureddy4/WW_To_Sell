at first created drawable_menu.xml with all the icons and values under menu and set it to navigation_view
and created header in another xml with all the xml that need to be there on the upper part
for combining these two I used drawable layout in home.xml with one navigation view and linear layout. in limear layout i used frameview for fragment and toolbar. here for navigationview we should get a depencency
now for viewing each menu item I created xml file with each item in menu item list and creaed kotlin file for each layout. here only extended fragment but not used fragment directly from the new list
using fragment container I replaced FrameView in home.xml with fragments
